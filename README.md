### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jared Thorne and I am the founder of Thorne Research Group. I'm currently working on a multi media server, as well as all of the tooling that would be required to build it and other services like it.

If you'd like, you can get more information from my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF0FJmCiHCWlJrxUaG26GuQ).

<p align=center>Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.</p>
<p align=center>May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his holy Church.</p>
